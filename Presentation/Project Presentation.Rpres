Car Performance Analizer App
========================================================
type: sub-section
A *shiny* app was created to analise and predict car performance based on the *mtcars* dataset. The application has two main sections:

1. **Data Analysis**
  - Allows user to customize a scatterplot based on the dataset.
  - Explains and calculates which is the best linear regression model for this dataset.

2. **Prediction**
  - Allows user to introduce car attributes and calculates a performance prediction.
 
mtcars Dataset
=====================
type: sub-section

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

- [, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
- [, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
- [, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
- [, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
- [, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
- [, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
- [, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
- [, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
- [, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- [,10]	gear	Number of forward gears
- [,11]	carb	Number of carburetors

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars,3)
```

Example Plot
=====================
```{r}
shiny::includeHTML("./Project Presentation-figure/plot_ly.html")
```

Example Prediction Calculation
=====================
type: sub-section
The following calculations were performed in order to predict car performance accourding to user input:

```{r}
library(caret)
data<-mtcars[,c(1,2,4,6,9)]
row.names(data)<-c()
inTrain  <- createDataPartition(data$mpg, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- data[inTrain, ]
testing  <- data[-inTrain, ]
set.seed(12345)
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
Mod_RF <- train(mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt + am, data=training, method="rf", trControl=control)
Mod_RF$finalModel
user_input<-data.frame(3500,200,4,0)
colnames(user_input)<-c("wt","hp","cyl","am")
predict(Mod_RF, user_input)

```
